# Socket.IO Connectivity Fixes for Vercel Deployment

## Problem Summary
Real-time audio transcription was failing with Socket.IO connectivity errors showing repeated 400/500 HTTP errors to the Vercel Socket.IO endpoint.

## Root Cause Analysis
Vercel's serverless environment has limitations with persistent WebSocket connections:
1. Serverless functions have execution time limits (30 seconds)
2. WebSocket connections don't persist across function invocations
3. Default Socket.IO configuration is optimized for traditional servers, not serverless

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Vercel Configuration Updates (`vercel.json`)
- Added explicit Socket.IO route handling: `/socket.io/(.*)`
- Increased function timeout to 30 seconds maximum
- Proper routing to ensure Socket.IO endpoints are handled correctly

### 2. Socket.IO Server Configuration (`app/app.py`)
- Added Vercel-compatible Socket.IO settings:
  - `transports=['polling', 'websocket']` - Prefer HTTP polling over WebSocket
  - `ping_timeout=20` and `ping_interval=10` - Reduced timeouts for serverless
  - `async_mode='threading'` - Better serverless compatibility

### 3. Client-Side Connection Updates
- Updated WebSocket manager (`static/js/websocket-manager.js`):
  - Added Vercel-specific connection options
  - Enabled transport fallback to HTTP polling
  - Increased timeout and retry settings

- Updated AssemblyAI service (`static/js/assemblyai-service.js`):
  - Added proper connection event handling
  - Wait for connection before emitting events
  - Better error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 4. Serverless Optimization Patches (`app/serverless_patch.py`)
- Created dedicated serverless compatibility layer
- Optimized Socket.IO server options for Vercel environment
- Added serverless-specific event handlers

### 5. Application Entry Point (`vercel_app.py`)
- Set production environment explicitly for Vercel
- Export Flask app as `application` for WSGI compatibility
- Better logging for debugging serverless issues

### 6. Test Endpoints (`app/socketio_test.py`)
- Added Socket.IO connectivity test endpoints
- Simple ping/pong test for connection validation
- Debug endpoints to verify server status

## Verification Steps

1. **Test Socket.IO Connectivity:**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console on deployed site:
   const socket = io();
   socket.emit('test_connection', {test: 'data'});
   socket.on('test_response', (data) => console.log('Response:', data));
   ```

2. **Check Server Status:**
   Visit: `https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/test/socketio`

3. **Monitor Connection Transport:**
   Check browser Network tab for Socket.IO transport method (should prefer polling)

## Expected Results

- Socket.IO connections should establish successfully using HTTP polling
- Real-time audio transcription should work with reduced latency
- Connection errors (400/500) should be eliminated
- Graceful fallback to Web Speech API if Socket.IO fails

## Technical Notes

- Vercel serverless functions work best with HTTP polling rather than persistent WebSockets
- Connection timeout limits are necessary due to serverless execution constraints
- Client-side retry logic is essential for serverless environment reliability
- AssemblyAI streaming may need to use their HTTP API instead of WebSocket for better serverless compatibility

## Monitoring

- Check Vercel function logs for Socket.IO connection attempts
- Monitor browser console for connection status messages
- Verify transport method in Network tab (should show polling, not websocket)
- Test audio transcription functionality end-to-end

These fixes should resolve the Socket.IO connectivity issues and enable real-time audio transcription to work properly on Vercel's serverless platform.
